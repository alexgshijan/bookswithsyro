      <h1>👨🏽‍🦳 Hi, I'm Alex Shijan</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a future seminarian for the Syro-Malabar Church (Eparchy of Great Britain). This site is a small effort to
        collect and share useful documents — pastoral letters, legal notices, catechetical texts, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about making our Church's resources more accessible — to create a digital archive that makes these texts easy to find and share.
      </p>

		If you have a document to submit, or just want to get in touch, email me at <a href="mailto:alexgshijan@gmail.com">alexgshijan@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope is simple: that our Mar Thoma Nazrani heritage thrives — not just in spirit, but in the words and documents we pass on to future generations.
