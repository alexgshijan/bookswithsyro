      <h1>[ܞ] Books With Syro</h1>
      

      <p>
        Welcome to BooksWithSyro — The (unofficial) Syro-Malabar Apologetics page, this is an online archive dedicated to the tradition of the Syro-Malabar Church. 
        This site aims to preserve and share important documents, traditions, and reflections that help strengthen our Mar Thoma Nazrani identity.<br>
        When I was beginning my deeper faith journey, one thing I noticed was how difficult it was to find accessible, reliable resources specifically about the Syro-Malabar Church — its history, liturgy, spirituality, and traditions.  
There were plenty of general Catholic resources, but very little that helped me understand and appreciate my own Church's unique identity as a Mar Thoma Nazrani.  
That gap is partly what inspired me to start <i>BooksWithSyro</i>.

<b>Divine Praises</b><br>
The Divine Praises or the Liturgy of the Hours of the Syro-Malabar Church can be expressed as the heart beat of our church. It's an expression of our continous prayers to God without ceasing. While traditionally we have the 7 hours of the day as part of our jewish tradition, it is the norm for most people to particpate in Ramsa (evening prayer), Lelya (night prayer) and Sapra (morning prayer). As such the synod approved text for those three hours along with their season particular prayers, psalms and hymns are available in the <a href=loth>Divine Praises page</a>. A more indepth look into the Divine Praises on <a href=blog/loth>my blog post</a>.
