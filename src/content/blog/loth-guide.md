As I noted in my article [What are the Liturgy of The Hours?](/blog/loth), The Liturgies of the Hours, "Yamaprathanakal" or Divine Praises are the heartbeat of the Syro-Malabar Church. They are tied to specific hours and to the rhythm of the liturgical calendar. It allows us to come together as a community, displaced as we are, to celebrate our day, give thanks to God and sanctify time itself. These Divine Praises allow us to transform our days into prayers to God. But praying them, especially if we are dependant on using [online copies](/loth/), can be difficult. As such, the following guide hopes to assist make that process smoother.

### Reading of the Day

The Liturgical day starts with Ramsha of the previous day. There are still remnants of this understanding of the day in celebrations of Christmas Eve, and similar times. That is to say Liturgical Sunday starts with Saturday's Ramsha. As such the readings for Ramsha and Lelya must also be from the following day. I would recommend using [SyroCalender's daily reading selector](https://syrocalendar.com/daily-readings/) or referencing any Syro-Malabar reading calendar / app (SyroMalabar Praarthanakal or SyroMalabar) to select the following day's readings.

### The Hours of the Day

Each Liturgy of the Hour has a set time prescribed by the church. For Ramsha that is around 6PM to 9PM, for Lelya that is before we sleep (9PM to 12AM), for Sapra that is when we wake up (6AM to 9AM). The church exhorts it's people to pray these prayers at these set times (CCC 1174 - 1178).
