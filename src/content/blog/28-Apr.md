Yesterday marked my last day as part of the Liturgy Team for the Youth (SMYM) and Migrant Commission. It was bittersweet — I’ll really miss these guys. Our team first came together in the lead-up to Handhoosa 24, an eparchial youth gathering for SMYMGB.

### Handhoosa 24

Handhoosa was an opportunity not only for fellowship and building stronger ties within our youth community but also for us to meet Mar Raphael Thattil, the Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church. Our liturgy team was responsible for everything liturgical — preparing the stage for the Qurbana, coordinating altar servers, organising the distribution of the Eucharist, designing slides, and even creating a high-resolution backwall.

It was a fun, albeit stressful, task. Over two months, we prepared the logistics for a Qurbana accommodating 2,500 participants — in a space that was certainly not designed for that many people!

The day itself was amazing, I was able to meet up with all these really cool people, had great conversations, and even managed to snap selfies with both Bishop Mar Joseph Srambickal and Mar Raphael Thattil. Really, it made what had been 2 long months of planning, feel worth it.  It was also the first time I met Jacob, Jeswin, Angeline, and Nevin in person — after countless hours spent together on calls. The night ended on a high and despite some of the issues that came following it, I can still say I was proud of what we accomplished as a team.

### The Youth and Migrant Commission

Following Handhoosa, the idea of forming specific teams dedicated to different services took root. These teams, along with SMYM, eventually became known as the Youth and Migrant Commission (YMC).

We were invited to meet with the bishop to present our vision for SMYM, outline how other teams could contribute, and discuss what we hoped to accomplish. It was another great chance to reconnect with the friends I'd made at Handhoosa — Jacob as head of the Liturgy Team, Jeswin leading the Mobilisation Team, Angeline leading the Nuhra Service Team, and myself leading the Safeguarding Team (essentially a mix of child safety, health, and data privacy responsibilities).

In hindsight, it’s clear that at the time, none of us really knew what exactly the YMC was supposed to be — and honestly, even today, many of our youth still don’t fully know what it stands for. But simply put, it was meant to be a way to appoint talented youth into roles based on ability rather than the usual election process, which didn’t always showcase those talents.

The meeting went well: Qurbana, talks from the leads and regional teams, an address from the bishop, and even some fellowship and games. At that point, most YMC teams were just the leads — with little to no actual team members yet.

### The Liturgy team

About two weeks after the initial YMC meet, I asked Jacob if I could join the Liturgy Team, and he happily welcomed me on board. We started meeting weekly to share updates, brainstorm ideas, and simply stay connected.

One of our first initiatives was to form regional liturgy teams to support future projects. After that, we created a video series for Lent — *Journey to Gagultha* — which you can still find on the SMYMGB Instagram page! (It's pretty cool, feel free to check it out.)

And that brings us to yesterday's meeting.

### My Last Liturgy Team Call

As always, we started with a short prayer. I presented the analytics on how our video series performed, and then we discussed our next big initiative: a Suriyani singing competition. As the meeting wrapped up, I reminded everyone that this would be my last time joining them. I thanked them for being such an amazing team and wished them all the best in their future endeavors.

Today is April 28th. Tomorrow is the 29th, and the day after, the 30th. But Thursday, May 1st, marks my official last day with SMYM.

Funny enough, when I first told my friends I was leaving SMYM, their immediate guesses were:  

1. "Are you getting married?" (No.)  
2. "Are you apostatising?" (Also no.)  

That had them stumped until I finally revealed the real reason: I'm joining seminary!  
Wild surprise, right? Especially considering I haven't even finished my About page yet — so this is probably the first time I’m mentioning it publicly.

### Looking Ahead

During our last meeting, Jaisama Aunty (also part of the Liturgy Team) suggested I should build an online archive of books, articles, and other resources — something I had already been planning for *BooksWithSyro*. I told her about it, and she encouraged me even further, mentioning that if it’s successful, we could even reach out to SEERI and scholars like Sebastian Brock for licenses to publish and make their works more accessible.

Her suggestion — and the support she showed — is part of why I’m writing this today. Even though I’m stepping away from the Liturgy Team, there are still ways I can contribute and serve our youth.
