Hi, I’m Alex — a book-loving Catholic from Cardiff with a deep-rooted faith, a passion for reading, and a growing call to serve. BooksWithSyro is where those loves meet: a space to explore Syro-Malabar Catholic and Mar Thoma Nazrani tradition, share insights, and journey deeper into the mystery of faith through literature. Whether you're here for articles, recomendations or reflections, I’m glad you stopped by.
