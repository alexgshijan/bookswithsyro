There are many elements that make up the life and constitution of a Church: its creed, sacraments, life of charity and mission, leadership, history, and much more. But all of its various aspects point to its ultimate goal, which is the union with God we call prayer. There are, of course, many kinds of prayer, esppecially on the part of an individual member of a Church, but if one were to ask what is *the* prayer *of* any given apostolic Church taken collectively, the answer would in every case be its liturgy of the hours. Every evening, morning, and other times of the day, the Church officially and formally gathers and sings it's praises to God in the tradition it has developed from its earliest beginnings. These are the Divine Praises: the Church's heartbeat; the way it expresses its life from moment to moment.

These are, then, daily organizations of time, where the Church teaches us what we should sing to God, and indeed what we should feel, every day. Every single morning, the Church tells us to pray Psalm 100, glorifying God and thanking him for creating the world and (according to the antiphon added) especially for giving us light: *"Lord, the giver of light, We render you praise."* Every single evening, the Church tells us to pray Psalm 140, and to ask God to accept our prayer like the incense offered every evening in the Temple, and Psalm 118, which reminds us that, despite the setting of the sun and the encroaching darkness, God's word is a lamp for our feet and a light for our paths. These prayers, repeated (some would say *ad nauseam*) on a daily basis, are not meant to make us sick of them, but rather to form our souls. If we do not feel like thanking God for his creation in the morning or asking for his light in the evening, well, the Church says "too bad," because doing so is good for us, and she is our mother who teaches us to feel what we should feel, by example and by practice.

In the Church of the East,[^1] the new liturgical day begins not at midnight or in the morning, but when the sun goes down in the evening. This ancient way of thinking about time hearkens back to Genesis 1:5 "there was evening and there was morning, one day."[^2] Evening is named first here, and evening is consequently the first part of the new day in the liturgy. There are still remnants of this understanding of the day in celebrations of Christmas Eve, and similar times. Th first "hour" or "office" of the "liturgy of the hours" is therefore *Ramsa* or Evening Prayer. The other major "office" or "official prayer time" is *Sapra* or Morning Prayer.[^3]

These three prayer times, Evening, [ Night, ] and Morning, make up what is called the "Cathedral" set of prayers, which were designed for the life of everyday faithful to attend at their local parish church. Indeed there is a legislation requiring the faithful to attend these prayers as early as the first Synod of the Church of the East in 410AD.[^4] This is, in fact, one of the remarkable aspects of the liturgy of the hours of the Church of the East in particular, that to a great degree it is intended to be part of the life of all the members of the Church, not only clergy and monks.[^5]

[^3]: The Second Session of the XXX Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church approved a text that added Lelya to this list of major hours on the Feast of Denaha in January 2023. This was followed by an exhortation via circular from the then Major Archbishop of the Syro Malabar Church, Cardinal George Allencherry, that "[The Divine Praises] should be recited at the cathedrals and in the churches every day especially on Sundays and on the days of obligation as per the directives of Canon Law (CCEO c.199 §2)," on February 5, 2023.
