Hi there, my name is Alex George Shijan.  
I'll go into more depth about who I am on the [About](/about) page, but briefly: I’m a Syro-Malabar Catholic from the Eparchy of Great Britain. I have some basic web development skills, and I want to use them in service of our Church and community.

When I was beginning my deeper faith journey, one thing I noticed was how difficult it was to find accessible, reliable resources specifically about the Syro-Malabar Church — its history, liturgy, spirituality, and traditions.  
There were plenty of general Catholic resources, but very little that helped me understand and appreciate my own Church's unique identity as a Mar Thoma Nazrani.  
That gap is partly what inspired me to start *BooksWithSyro*.

I want to build a document archive — something akin to the Malankara Library — dedicated specifically to the Syro-Malabar Church. My hope is to create a resource that helps strengthen our community, ensuring that our Mar Thoma Nazrani heritage thrives not just in spirit, but in the words, traditions, and documents we pass on to future generations.

## Current Progress and Future Plans

So far, I’ve set up a frontend (this website) and configured a D2 bucket to store files.  
The next step is to build a system for managing uploads (restricted to myself and specific admin accounts). The idea is to create a workflow where a file is:

- Uploaded
- Metadata is added (category, description, tags/keywords)
- Watermarked (if necessary)
- Stored securely in the bucket
- Referenced through an updated JSON index

I'm also exploring the possibility of automating metadata tagging using AI or OCR — something worth experimenting with.

After that, I’ll focus on developing a proper search index and setting up a browsable library, organized neatly by category or topic.

## How You Can Help

This is still in its early stages, but if you’d like to support the project, here are some ways you can help:

- Suggest documents, traditions, or resources you think should be archived
- Share the project with others who might find it useful
- Pray for the success of this little initiative!

In the future, once the archive is more developed, I may open up more ways for the community to contribute directly — stay tuned.

## Upcoming Milestones

- Launching the upload and metadata management system  
- Uploading the first batch of documents  
- Developing basic search functionality  
- Opening a feedback form for improvements
