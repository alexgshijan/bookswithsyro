Hi there, my name is Alex George Shijan (pseudonym: *BooksWithSyro*).  
I'll go into more depth about who I am on the [About](/about) page, but briefly: I’m a Syro-Malabar Catholic from the Eparchy of Great Britain. I have some basic web development skills, and I want to use them in service of our Church and community.

I’ve tried to do this in various ways (more failures than successes), but my current project is to build a document archive — something akin to the Malankara Library — dedicated to the Syro-Malabar Church. My hope is to create a resource that helps strengthen our community, ensuring that our Mar Thoma Nazrani heritage thrives not just in spirit, but in the words, traditions, and documents we pass on to future generations.

## Current Progress and Future Plans

So far, I’ve set up a frontend (this website) and configured a D2 bucket to store files.  
The next step is to build a system for managing uploads (restricted to myself and specific admin accounts). The idea is to create a workflow where a file is:

- Uploaded
- Metadata is added (category, description, tags/keywords)
- Watermarked (if necessary) or even just possible appending BookWithSyro at the end of the file title
- Stored securely in the bucket
- Referenced through an updated JSON index

I'm also exploring the possibility of automating metadata tagging using AI or some form of OCR — something worth experimenting with.

After that, I’ll need to work on developing a search index and setting up a browsable library, probably organized by category or topic. We'll see how it evolves!
