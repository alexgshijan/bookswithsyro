Hi there, my name is Alex George Shijan (Pseudonym : BooksWithSyro). I'll be going into more depth of who I am in the [About](/about) page, but in brief I'm a Syro-Malabar Catholic from the Eparchy of Great Britian. I have some basic webdev skills and I want to use it in service of our church and community. I've tried to do this in a range of ways (more fails than successes), but my current attempt is to build a document archive, not unlike the malankara library. My hope is to build this up as a resource dedicated to the Syro-Malabar church, a place to help build up our community - that our Mar Thoma Nazrani heritage thrives not just in spirit, but in the words, traditions and documents we pass on to future generations.

## Current Progress and Future Plans

I've currently setup a frontend (this webpage) and also configured a D2 bucket to store files. Next I need to buld the system to manage uploads (available only to me / specific admin account), where the file is uploaded, metadata added (category/ description/ tags or keywords), watermarked, stored in the bucket and the JSON updated to reference the file. It may be possible to get the tagging done with ai / some sort of OCR, it's something that I should look into. Following that I would need to work on a search index and probably some sort of library via split up by category. Will see.

This is BooksWithSyro, signing off,
