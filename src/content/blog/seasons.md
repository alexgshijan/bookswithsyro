Within the context of the Qurbana and Divine Praises, each liturgical season introduces specific psalms, hymns, and readings tied to key moments in salvation history: the angel's annunciation to Mary, the birth of Christ, his baptism, his battle with the devil in the desert, his passion, death, resurrection, and ascension, the descent of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the Apostles, the repentance of the nations, the victory of the cross and the final crowning of the Church in heavenly glory. Year after year, the Church invites us to be absorbed not only into our own lives and concerns, but more and more into the life of Christ, so that we can live with eyes open to a larger world, where God's salvation is the focus. These aren’t abstract commemorations. They are invitations to reorder your time, attention, and affections around the events that define the Christian faith.

### Season of Annunciation (Suvara)

This season centers around the joyful announcement of the Incarnation of Isho Mshiha and fulfillment of the Old Testament. It is the first liturgical season and consists of the 4 weeks leading up to Christmas. Suvara is a syriac word meaning "hope" or "expectation", in malayalam it is called "Mangalavarthakalam" or the Seaon of Good News.

Through Christ's Incarnation, God entered the world in human form, preparing the way for the salvific sacrifice to come. The father aims to lead all of mankind to Jesus who is Emmanuel, "God with us".

This season's readings focus on the annunciation and messianic prophecies, highlighting God's unfolding plans. These include the annunciation of the births of Issac, Samson, Yohanan Mamdana (John the Baptist) and Isho. Each prophecy reveals how Jesus' birth fulfills God's promise to restore the world through the Mshiha.

In this season Marth Mariyam, Mother Mary, holds a central place of veneration. She is the divine instrument through whom God entered the world by humbly submitting herself to God's will with her Fiat, "Let it be done to me according to Your Word." By accepting God's plan, she became the Theotokos, and a model for all believers in her faith and obedience.

During this Season, the Church invites us to prepare for the coming of the Messiah through prayer and penance in a 25-day fast.

### Season of Nativity (Yalda)

This season is the shortest season within our calender, with only 2 weeks. Over these two weeks we celebrate the birth of Isho Mshiha as the Saviour of the world. Yalda is a syriac word meaning "Birth", in malayalam it is called "Piravikalam" or Seaon of Birth.

In Isho's time, shepherds were often isolated and seen as unclean because of their work. Their presence in the nativity story shows that God came for all, including the poor, humble and marginalised [Luke 2:15].

The Magi followed the star, seeking truth with minds open to divine guidance, leading them to the child Isho. They knelt before him, offered him gifts, and were the first to worship Him as God. By accepting the adoration of these Gentiles, Isho revealed that His invitation to redemption embraces all of humanity, not just the Jews.

- Frankincese - Divinity - Isho the Son of God
- Gold - Royalty - Isho the King
- Myrrh - Suffering - Iho the Prophet

By choosing to come into the world in the most modest and unassuming way, He revealed God's boundless love for all, especially the poor and the humble [cf. Luke 2:7]. In this season, we joyfully celebrate the birth of Maran Isho Mshiha, who brings hope and light into our lives.

### Season of Epiphany (Denha)

The season is marked by reflections on the manifestation of Isho to the world. Denha is a Syriac word meaning "sunrise", "revelation", or "manifestation". 

This season starts with the Feast of Denha commerating the baptism of Isho Mshiha, here the Holy Trinity is revealed, and Isho's public ministry commences.

In Kerala, there are two Syriac traditions associated with the Feast.

- Pindi-Kuthi Perunnal - Isho Mshiha, the Light of the world, is commemorated by raising a plantain trunk in front of the church, pierced with lamps & flags.
- Rakkuli Perunnal - the faithful take a ritual bath in a water body near the church, commemorating the baptism of Isho

This season reveals the personality of Isho through his public ministry as Messiah. A key event is the the miracle at the wedding feast of Cana, revealing His divine power and compassion.

This season calls us trust in Isho as the source of light and salvation. As His followers, we are called to be instruments through which His light shines, allowing His love and grace to touch the lives of others.

### Season of Great Fast (Sawmba Ramba)

In this Season we refelect on Isho's temptation in the desert, His pasion, death and resurrection. Sawmba Ramba is a syriac phrase meaning Great Fast, "Nombukalam" in malayalam means "Season of Fasting".

The Season begins with Pethurtha Sunday, meaning "turning back". IT signifies that the days of rich food and celebrations are over. Until the Sunday of Ressurection, marriages and public feasts are prohibited. We are encouraged to unite ourselves with Isho's passion and death by sharing our treasures and detaching from wordly things.

The Syro-Malabar Church observes 50^* days of fasting in this season. It highlights the continuous period of preparation, similar to the Israelites' time in the desert. It also mirrors the 50 days of celebration from Resurrection to Pentecost.

In her liturgical readings, the Church meditates on Biblical periods of preparation, trial, and suffering like:

- The Israelites in the desert
- Noah's family on the ark
- Isho Mshiha's fasting and the temptation in the wilderness

Over 7 weeks of fasting, penance and almsgibing, the Church invites us to turn back to God and embrace His unfailing love, revealed at Golgotha. We are called to prepare for our own deaths and vigilantly avoid sin to be resurrected into Isho Mshiha

### Season of Resurrection

This Season consists of the seven weeks between Easter and Pentecost. The Church celebrates Isho's victory over death and the new life through His resurrection.

It highlights the origins of the Messianic community, symbolised by the sacrament of baptism. The early Syro-Malabar Church dedicated this season's first week to honouring the newly baptised, or "new Christians" [Romans 6:4-5]

The Sunday after Easter commemorates St Thomas' profession of faith : "My Lord and My God" or in the Aramaic tongue, "Mar Walah".

In this season, the church recalls Isho's promise to remain with His Bride for eterntiy. This promise was fulfilled when He gave authority to Peter, the apostles, and their successors to shepherd His flock and uphold His mission.

### Season of Apostles (Shliha)

This season begins with the Feast of Pentecost, it focuses on the gift of the Ruha d'Qudsha and the divine call to preach the salvific message.

In the Old Testament, the feast of Pentecost was known as the feast of offering where the first fruits of the harvest season were gifted to God. After the triumph of Isho Mshiha, the new meaning of Pentecost became the descent of the Ruha d'Qudsha and the official inaugaration of the Church known as "Ecclesia".

Shlihas, meaning "ones who are sent" in Syriac, were filled with the Ruha d'Qudsha and sent across the world to proclaim the salvific message.

In this season we remember the mission the Shlihas carried out fearlessly - a reminder for us to rely on the Ruha d'Qudsha to help us be witnesses of Isho Mshiha in any situation. The season reminds us of our call to bear witness to the Word of God with courage and conviction, just like the Shlihas.

### Season of Summer (Khaitha)

This season connects the season of Apostles with that of Eliȷah-Cross-Moses. It reminds us of the activities of the Church and the neccesity of being prepared for the second coming of the Saviour. 

It is a time that commemorates and celebrates the growth of the Church as well as the harvesting of spiritual fruits. This season reminds us that the Church is rooted and extended to the far corners of the world by the missionary activities of the martyrs and apostles. The Church invites the faithful to imitate this exemplary life to producee spiritual fruits. The Lord patiently awaits for the fruits of goodness from the children of the Church,

The readings of this season give warnings about the tradegies if we do not produce good fruit. Therefore the season of Khaitha teaches to store treasures in heaven without being trapped in wordliness

### Season of Eliȷah-Cross-Moses (Eliya-Sleeva-Muse)

This season is symbolized by the Slīva (Cross), representing victory over evil, death, and suffering. It commemorates how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament through the New Covenant. The Slīva invites us to be vigilant against temptations, be faithful and wait for the second coming of Jesus which sets us free from our sins.

In the Epiphany, this fulfillment of the Old Testament is made clear. Moses, the Law of the Old Testament, and Elijah, the Prophets of the Old Testament, are present with Christ during his transfiguration when God's voice from heaven commands us to "Listen to Him". Thus the Law and the Prophets in the Old Testament find their fulfillment in Jesus, the living embodiement of the New Covenenat.

The Sliva (Cross) invites the faithful to embrace their own suffering, like Jesus who glorified God through his complete surrendance and obedience to His Father. The Syro-Malabar Church uses the Sliva as a symbol for salvation. Thus, we celebrate the Feast of the Exaltation of the Sliva. A parallel to (type of) the Sliva within the old testament is that of the Bronze Serpent. Just as Moses lifted up the Bronze Serpent in the wilderness (John 3:14a), so to was the Son of Man lifted up for our sake (John 3:14b). Just as the Israelites were saved by looking at the Bronze Serpent, we are called to set our gaze to Jesus on the Sliva for our salvation.

The overarching theme of this season is the victory of the Sliva over evil, death and suffering. In this season we commemorate the Old Testament while preparing for the Second Coming.

### Season of the Dedication of the Church

In this season, the faithful commemorates the meeting of the Church with Christ in person. Just as a bride meeting her groom at the altar, the prayers and hymns of the season celebrates the joy of the bride. The Church adorned in glory by her bridegroom, Christ.

The dedication of the Church is the last liturgical season of the calendar year. It signifies the victory of the Church in the eschaton (final event in divine plan) culminating at entry of Church in Heavenly Jerusalem.

The Season of Dedication consists of four weeks to reflect on Four significant dedication of Holy Places in the Old Testament.

- The Tabernacle -  built by Moses in the wilderness (Exodus 40:1-17)
- The Tent of Meeting - established by Joshua in Canaan, the Promised Land (Joshua 18:1)
- Solomon's Temple - the First Permanent Temple (1 Kings 8:62-66)
- The Second Temple - Restoration of the Temple after Babylonian exile (Ezra 3:2)

With each dedication symbolising a step towards true Worship. this season reminds us of God's call to consecrate ourselves as His people and prepare for the eternal dwelling with Christ. However, only those who remain vigilant, like the wise virgins, will be ready to enter the tabernacle of heaven when the Master comes. Just as in the parable of the ten virgins, the Church - the Bride - must endure trials and remain watchful to prepare for her bridgegroom's arrival.

In this season, the Church teaches us to live with heaven in our sights. Though this world will pass away, we are called to remain vigilant, preparing ourselves for Christ's return, so he may welcome us into his heavenly dwelling.
