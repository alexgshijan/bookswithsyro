Within the context of the Qurbana and Divine Praises, each liturgical season introduces specific psalms, hymns, and readings tied to key moments in salvation history: the angel's annunciation to Mary, the birth of Christ, his baptism, his battle with the devil in the desert, his passion, death, resurrection, and ascension, the descent of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the Apostles, the repentance of the nations, the victory of the cross and the final crowning of the Church in heavenly glory. Year after year, the Church invites us to be absorbed not only into our own lives and concerns, but more and more into the life of Christ, so that we can live with eyes open to a larger world, where God's salvation is the focus. These aren’t abstract commemorations. They are invitations to reorder your time, attention, and affections around the events that define the Christian faith.

### Season of Annunciation

This season prepares us for the feast of the Nativity of Jesus. This season is called ‘Subbara’ which in Syriac language means ‘declaration’, ‘announcement’ etc. This season recalls the announcement of the birth of John the Baptist, the promise of salvation offered by God, God’s covenant with humanity and the prophecies about the Saviour. During this season, we also meditate on the role of Mary in the history of Salvation.

### Season of Nativity

During this season, we commemorate the birth of Jesus, which is the central theme of this season, the fufillment of the expectations and prophesies of the Old Testament.

### Season of Epiphany (Denha)

The word for Epiphany in Syriac is ‘Denha’ which means ‘dawn’, ‘revelation’, ‘manifestation’ etc. The most important themes commemorated during these days are the baptism of Jesus, His public life, His divine and human nature, His intimate relationship with the Father and the Holy Spirit and His self-emptying love. This period reminds us also of our own baptism and the responsibilities we have undertaken with it.

### Season of Great Lent (Sawmba Ramba)

During this season, we meditate upon man’s sin and its consequences, the need for repentance and conversion, the infinite love and mercy of God towards repentant sinners and the passion, death and burial of Jesus Christ, in order to redeem us. The Church reminds us to spend the Lenten period in fervent prayer, sincere fasting and generous almsgiving and to eradicate our evil desires. Like Jesus who conquered death and rose again to eternal life, let us also die to sin and enter into eternal life.

### Season of Resurrection

It is a time of joy recalling the new life obtained through the resurrection of our Saviour. The important themes are the resurrection of Christ, His victory over sin, death and Satan. The cross which was a sign of folly became the sign of redemption and glory, the resurrection of Christ as a pledge of our resurrection, His resurrection as a basis of Christian faith etc.

### Season of Apostles

This season reminds us that all those who have received baptism and anointing are ‘beıng sent’. The main themes of this season are the works of the Holy Sprit, the deep relationship between the apostles and the Church i.e., the people of God, the spirit and unity of the early Church and the mission and missionary nature of the Church. Filled with the Holy Spirit, let us all try to be witnesses of Christ and His Gospel.

### Season of Summer 

It is the season of harvest. This season reminds us of the growth of the Church as a result of the missionary activities of the Apostles. Commemoration of the apostles and martyrs who were faithful to the Church is a special feature of this season. It reminds also of our responsibility to follow their lifestyle. It also reminds us that we too should be faithful to our Christian vocation and bring forth fruits of our Christian life.

### Season of Eliȷah-Cross-Moses

This season points to the second coming of our Lord and the ultimate victory of the cross. The central point of this season is the feast of the exaltation of the Cross. The main themes during this season are the end of the world, death and the last judgment. It exhorts us to be always alert against the temptations of the devil and to eradicate sin from our lives, and be always prepared for the second coming of Christ.

### Season of the Dedication of the Church

In this season, we remember that at the end of time, Jesus will offer the Church, which is His spouse, to the Father after the Last Judgment. Thus, the liturgical year reminds us that as Christians, we are called to attain the eternal glory through the Church.
