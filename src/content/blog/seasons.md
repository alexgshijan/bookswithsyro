Within the context of the Qurbana and Divine Praises, each liturgical season introduces specific psalms, hymns, and readings tied to key moments in salvation history: the angel's annunciation to Mary, the birth of Christ, his baptism, his battle with the devil in the desert, his passion, death, resurrection, and ascension, the descent of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the Apostles, the repentance of the nations, the victory of the cross and the final crowning of the Church in heavenly glory. Year after year, the Church invites us to be absorbed not only into our own lives and concerns, but more and more into the life of Christ, so that we can live with eyes open to a larger world, where God's salvation is the focus. These aren’t abstract commemorations. They are invitations to reorder your time, attention, and affections around the events that define the Christian faith.

### Season of Annunciation

This season prepares us for the feast of the Nativity of Jesus. This season is called ‘Subbara’ which in Syriac language means ‘declaration’, ‘announcement’ etc. This season recalls the announcement of the birth of John the Baptist, the promise of salvation offered by God, God’s covenant with humanity and the prophecies about the Saviour. During this season, we also meditate on the role of Mary in the history of Salvation.

### Season of Nativity

During this season, we commemorate the birth of Jesus, which is the central theme of this season, the fufillment of the expectations and prophesies of the Old Testament.

### Season of Epiphany (Denha)

The word for Epiphany in Syriac is ‘Denha’ which means ‘dawn’, ‘revelation’, ‘manifestation’ etc. The most important themes commemorated during these days are the baptism of Jesus, His public life, His divine and human nature, His intimate relationship with the Father and the Holy Spirit and His self-emptying love. This period reminds us also of our own baptism and the responsibilities we have undertaken with it.

### Season of Great Lent (Sawmba Ramba)

During this season, we meditate upon man’s sin and its consequences, the need for repentance and conversion, the infinite love and mercy of God towards repentant sinners and the passion, death and burial of Jesus Christ, in order to redeem us. The Church reminds us to spend the Lenten period in fervent prayer, sincere fasting and generous almsgiving and to eradicate our evil desires. Like Jesus who conquered death and rose again to eternal life, let us also die to sin and enter into eternal life.

### Season of Resurrection

It is a time of joy recalling the new life obtained through the resurrection of our Saviour. The important themes are the resurrection of Christ, His victory over sin, death and Satan. The cross which was a sign of folly became the sign of redemption and glory, the resurrection of Christ as a pledge of our resurrection, His resurrection as a basis of Christian faith etc.

### Season of Apostles

This season begins with the Feast of Pentecost, it focuses on the gift of the Ruha d'Qudsha and the divine call to preach the salvific message.

In the Old Testament, the feast of Pentecost was known as the feast of offering where the first fruits of the harvest season were gifted to God. After the triumph of Isho Mshiha, the new meaning of Pentecost became the descent of the Ruha d'Qudsha and the official inaugaration of the Church known as "Ecclesia".

Shlihas, meaning "ones who are sent" in Syriac, were filled with the Ruha d'Qudsha and sent across the world to proclaim the salvific message.

In this season we remember the mission the Shlihas carried out fearlessly - a reminder for us to rely on the Ruha d'Qudsha to help us be witnesses of Isho Mshiha in any situation. The season reminds us of our call to bear witness to the Word of God with courage and conviction, just like the Shlihas.

### Season of Summer (Khaitha)

This season connects the season of Apostles with that of Eliȷah-Cross-Moses. It reminds us of the activities of the Church and the neccesity of being prepared for the second coming of the Saviour. 

It is a time that commemorates and celebrates the growth of the Church as well as the harvesting of spiritual fruits. This season reminds us that the Church is rooted and extended to the far corners of the world by the missionary activities of the martyrs and apostles. The Church invites the faithful to imitate this exemplary life to producee spiritual fruits. The Lord patiently awaits for the fruits of goodness from the children of the Church,

The readings of this season give warnings about the tradegies if we do not produce good fruit. Therefore the season of Khaitha teaches to store treasures in heaven without being trapped in wordliness

### Season of Eliȷah-Cross-Moses

This season is symbolized by the Slīva (Cross), representing victory over evil, death, and suffering. It commemorates how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament through the New Covenant. The Slīva invites us to be vigilant against temptations, be faithful and wait for the second coming of Jesus which sets us free from our sins.

In the Epiphany, this fulfillment of the Old Testament is made clear. Moses, the Law of the Old Testament, and Elijah, the Prophets of the Old Testament, are present with Christ during his transfiguration when God's voice from heaven commands us to "Listen to Him". Thus the Law and the Prophets in the Old Testament find their fulfillment in Jesus, the living embodiement of the New Covenenat.

The Sliva (Cross) invites the faithful to embrace their own suffering, like Jesus who glorified God through his complete surrendance and obedience to His Father. The Syro-Malabar Church uses the Sliva as a symbol for salvation. Thus, we celebrate the Feast of the Exaltation of the Sliva. A parallel to (type of) the Sliva within the old testament is that of the Bronze Serpent. Just as Moses lifted up the Bronze Serpent in the wilderness (John 3:14a), so to was the Son of Man lifted up for our sake (John 3:14b). Just as the Israelites were saved by looking at the Bronze Serpent, we are called to set our gaze to Jesus on the Sliva for our salvation.

The overarching theme of this season is the victory of the Sliva over evil, death and suffering. In this season we commemorate the Old Testament while preparing for the Second Coming.

### Season of the Dedication of the Church

In this season, the faithful commemorates the meeting of the Church with Christ in person. Just as a bride meeting her groom at the altar, the prayers and hymns of the season celebrates the joy of the bride. The Church adorned in glory by her bridegroom, Christ.

The dedication of the Church is the last liturgical season of the calendar year. It signifies the victory of the Church in the eschaton (final event in divine plan) culminating at entry of Church in Heavenly Jerusalem.

The Season of Dedication consists of four weeks to reflect on Four significant dedication of Holy Places in the Old Testament.

- The Tabernacle -  built by Moses in the wilderness (Exodus 40:1-17)
- The Tent of Meeting - established by Joshua in Canaan, the Promised Land (Joshua 18:1)
- Solomon's Temple - the First Permanent Temple (1 Kings 8:62-66)
- The Second Temple - Restoration of the Temple after Babylonian exile (Ezra 3:2)

With each dedication symbolising a step towards true Worship. this season reminds us of God's call to consecrate ourselves as His people and prepare for the eternal dwelling with Christ. However, only those who remain vigilant, like the wise virgins, will be ready to enter the tabernacle of heaven when the Master comes. Just as in the parable of the ten virgins, the Church - the Bride - must endure trials and remain watchful to prepare for her bridgegroom's arrival.

In this season, the Church teaches us to live with heaven in our sights. Though this world will pass away, we are called to remain vigilant, preparing ourselves for Christ's return, so he may welcome us into his heavenly dwelling.
