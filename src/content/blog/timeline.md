This project draws heavily on *The Roots - The History of the Syro-Malabar Church*, a document put together by the Melbourne Eparchy's Youth Apstalate. It is now available for international purchase via their [Thoma Store](https://www.ya.org.au/thomastore/)

*From its humble beginnings in the first century AD to its present-day status as a vibrant and dynamic community, this book offers a comprehensive understanding of this remarkable church's development while fostering a deeper understanding of the shared roots and diverse expressions of the St. Thomas Christian faith. "The Roots - The History of the Syro-Malabar Church" is not merely a historical account but also a celebration of the enduring faith and resilience of a people who have preserved their unique identity while embracing the modern world.*

Estimated Completion date is around Septemeber, please bear with me
