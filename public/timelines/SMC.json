One such group was led by a merchant named Thomas of Cana. According to tradition, Thomas of Cana migrated to Muziris with a bishop and 345 East Syrian Christians from 72 families... The followers of Thomas of Cana, also known as Knayi Thomman, are today recognised as the Knanaya community. The Knanaya migration must be the pivotal point which brought an episcopal connection between the Indian and the Persian church. Since then, the Patriarch of Seleucia-Ctesiphon sent bishops to India regularly."
